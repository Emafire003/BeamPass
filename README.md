With this mod, the beacon beam will be able to pass through some blocks even if they are solid. 
For example, the Lodestone, because I thought that having a lodestone compass pointing to a beacon would be useful and cool. 
You could still do it by place it under it I guess... well whatever here we are!

## Commands
You can either use */beam* or */beampass*, they are aliases:
- `/beam add <block>` To make a block beampassable (aka, the beam will be able to pass through it)
- `/beam remove <block>` To remove it
- `/beam get` To get a list of all blocks that are made beampassable by this mod

## Setup
Download the mod from Modrinth or Curseforge and place it into your /mods/ folder, after you have installed the Fabric Loader!

Feel free to include this mod in any modpack, but please credit me, it would be kinda cool. And also, check out my other mods!
