With this mod, the beacon beam will be able to pass through some blocks even if they are solid. 
For example, the Lodestone, because I thought that having a lodestone compass pointing to a beacon would be useful and cool. 
You could still do it by place it under it I guess... well whatever here we are!

## Commands
You can either use */beam* or */beampass*, they are aliases:
- `/beam add <block>` To make a block beampassable (aka, the beam will be able to pass through it)
- `/beam remove <block>` To remove it
- `/beam get` To get a list of all blocks that are made beampassable by this mod

The permissions needed to use these commands are `beampass.commands.<thecommand>`, like `beampass.commands.add`

## Setup
You will need to install the mod both on server and the client in order to have the full effect. 

If you install it only on the server you will get the buff but won't see the beam, if you install it only on the client you will
only see the beam but it won't actually be active (so no buffs ecc.)

Feel free to include this mod in any modpack, but please credit me, it would be kinda cool. And also, check out my other mods!
