With this mod, the beacon beam will be able to pass through some blocks even if they are solid. 
For example, the Lodestone, because I thought that having a lodestone compass pointing to a beacon would be useful and cool. 
You could still do it by place it under it I guess... well whatever here we are!

##Commands
You can either use */beam* or */beampass*, they are aliases:
- `/beam add <block>` To make a block beampassable (aka, the beam will be able to pass through it)
- `/beam remove <block>` To remove it
- `/beam get` To get a list of all blocks that are made beampassable by this mod
